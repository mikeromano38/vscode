# Agent Mode Implementation

## Overview

The custom-chat extension now supports an "Agent" mode that allows users to interact with a different backend service for processing their requests. This mode is designed to be extensible and can be connected to various AI agent services.

## How to Use Agent Mode

### 1. Toggle to Agent Mode
- In the chat interface, you'll see two mode buttons: "Ask" and "Agent"
- Click on "Agent" to switch to agent mode
- The input field will show that you're now in agent mode

### 2. Send a Message
- Type your message in the input field
- Press Enter or click the send button
- The message will be processed by the Developer Agent Service

### 3. View Results
- A notification will appear confirming that the agent service processed your request
- The chat will show a confirmation message
- Check the VS Code notifications for detailed information

## Current Implementation

### DeveloperAgentService
The `DeveloperAgentService` class is currently implemented as a stub that:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Uses a singleton pattern for consistent service access
- **Message Processing**: Accepts messages and context information
- **Availability Check**: Verifies if the service is available
- **Configuration**: Provides service configuration information
- **Notification**: Shows a notification to confirm the agent mode is working

### File Structure
```
src/
├── developerAgentService.ts    # Main agent service implementation
├── webviewProvider.ts          # Updated to handle agent mode
├── extension.ts                # Added test command for agent service
└── ...
```

### Key Methods

#### `processAgentMessage(message: string, context?: any)`
- Processes user messages in agent mode
- Currently shows a notification with the message content
- Ready for integration with actual backend services

#### `isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>`
- Checks if the agent service is available
- Currently returns `true` (stub implementation)

#### `getConfiguration(): Promise<any>`
- Returns service configuration information
- Includes service type, version, and capabilities

## Testing

### Test Command
Run the test command to verify the agent service is working:

1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "DataVibe: Test Developer Agent Service"
3. Execute the command
4. Check the results in the notification

### Manual Testing
1. Open the DataVibe chat interface
2. Switch to "Agent" mode
3. Type a test message
4. Send the message
5. Verify that a notification appears

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation is a foundation that can be extended with:

### Backend Integration
- Connect to actual AI agent services
- Implement streaming responses
- Add authentication for agent services
- Support for different agent types

### Enhanced Features
- Agent-specific context handling
- File and workspace analysis
- Code generation and modification
- Integration with VS Code APIs

### Configuration
- Agent service endpoints
- Authentication credentials
- Service-specific settings
- Custom agent behaviors

## Technical Details

### Message Flow
1. User selects "Agent" mode in the UI
2. User types and sends a message
3. Message is parsed to extract mode and context
4. `_handleAgentMode()` is called
5. `DeveloperAgentService.processAgentMessage()` is invoked
6. Notification is shown to confirm processing
7. Success message is added to the chat

### Error Handling
- Service availability checks
- Graceful error messages
- Fallback to ask mode if needed
- Detailed error logging

### Extensibility
The service is designed to be easily extended:
- Add new agent types
- Implement different processing logic
- Connect to various backend services
- Add custom context handling

## Development Notes

### Current Limitations
- Stub implementation only shows notifications
- No actual backend integration
- Limited error handling
- No persistent state

### Next Steps
1. Implement actual backend service integration
2. Add streaming response support
3. Enhance error handling
4. Add configuration management
5. Implement agent-specific features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent mode not working**: Check if the extension is properly compiled
2. **No notifications**: Verify VS Code notification settings
3. **Test command fails**: Check the developer console for errors

### Debug Information
- All agent service calls are logged to the console
- Use the test command to verify service availability
- Check the VS Code developer tools for webview messages

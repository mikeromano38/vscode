## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The chat assistant works with your existing BigQuery project configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Not Responding
1. Ensure you're signed in to Google Cloud
2. Check that your BigQuery projects are configured
3. Verify the extension is properly activated

### No Table Context
- Make sure you have a BigQuery table open for table-specific responses
- The assistant can still provide general BigQuery guidance without table context

### Build Issues
- Ensure both webview and extension are built: `npm run build` in both directories
- Check that all Angular dependencies are installed

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external AI services for more advanced responses
- Query execution and result visualization
- Data profiling and statistical analysis
- Custom query templates and saved conversations
- Multi-language support for international users

## Contributing

The chat participant feature is built with extensibility in mind. New response types and AI capabilities can be easily added to the `generateAIResponse` function in `extension.ts`.
